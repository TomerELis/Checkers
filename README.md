# Checkers
Players can only move diagonally and only move forward, meaning toward the opposite player's side.

It is not possible to "eat" more than one opposing player in each move.

The game will end when a player reaches the farthest row for him (the row numbered 0 for a white player or the row numbered 7 for a black player)
or when a player has "eaten" all of his opponent's soldiers.

A player can quit by enter 999 on his turn.

The first move is always reserved for the black player ('X')
